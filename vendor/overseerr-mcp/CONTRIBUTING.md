## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Access to a Seerr or Overseerr instance for testing

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhomen368/overseerr-mcp.git
   cd overseerr-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your test credentials:
   ```env
   SEERR_URL=https://your-test-seerr.com
   SEERR_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Test locally:
   ```bash
   node build/index.js
   ```

### Development Workflow

- **Watch mode** for automatic rebuilds: `npm run watch`
- **Manual build**: `npm run build`

## Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Build the project successfully
2. Test with a real Seerr or Overseerr instance
3. Verify all existing functionality still works
4. Test your new features/fixes

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions/classes
- Include usage examples for new features

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests where appropriate

Example:
```
Add support for custom quality profiles

- Add profileId parameter to request_media tool
- Update documentation with examples
- Fixes #123
```

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md (if present)
3. Create git tag with version number
4. Push tag to trigger Docker build workflow
