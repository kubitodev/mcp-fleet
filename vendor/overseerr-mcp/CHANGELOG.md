## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Unit test layer**: Added 51 assertions covering availability classification, media status helpers, and title normalization, with the suite now running in CI

### Fixed
- **Duplicate request validation**: `validateFirst` now blocks requests for media in pending, processing, partially available, and available states
- **Season request validation**: Empty season arrays are rejected before dry-run handling or API calls
- **Season availability checks**: Explicitly requested seasons are evaluated individually instead of being blocked by show-level tracking alone
- **API cache consistency**: Media details are invalidated after request approval, decline, and deletion
- **API request safety**: Mutation requests are no longer retried, avoiding duplicate side effects; search language values are URL-encoded

### Changed
- **Seerr API client**: Replaced raw API calls with a typed `SeerrApiClient` that centralizes caching, retry behavior, and request handling
- **Availability classification**: Extracted availability decisions from dedupe processing into a focused classifier
- **Docker image**: Production dependencies are prepared in the builder stage, and npm is removed from the runtime image to reduce its CVE exposure
- **CI**: Upgraded release jobs to Node.js 22, added unit tests, hardened lockfile handling, and removed redundant CodeQL build steps
- **Dependencies**: Updated Axios to 1.19.0, TypeScript to 7.0.2, Node.js types to 26.2.0, Commitlint to 21.2.2, and related transitive packages

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Streamable HTTP transport**: Replaced legacy SSE transport with the MCP Streamable HTTP transport, enabling proper multi-session support and broader client compatibility

### Fixed
- **Session management**: Hardened HTTP session handling — unknown session IDs now return 404, requests without a session ID return 400
- **Pagination metadata**: Fixed `pageInfo` always returning `undefined` in `manage_media_requests` list responses due to a casing mismatch (`PageInfo` → `pageInfo`)

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Bumped `@commitlint/cli` to 21.0.2, `@commitlint/config-conventional` to 21.0.2, `@types/node` to 25.9.1, `qs` (transitive); patched `hono` to 4.12.23 to resolve moderate security vulnerabilities (IP restriction bypass, cookie injection, JWT scheme validation, path routing)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Request API path**: Fixed `manage_media_requests` returning 404 errors — the list/summary endpoints were using `/requests` (plural) instead of the correct `/request` (singular) API path

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Bumped `@commitlint/cli` to 21.0.1, `@commitlint/config-conventional` to 21.0.1, `@types/node` to 25.9.0, `axios` to 1.16.1, `typescript` to 6.0.3, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.29.0
- **Docker**: Bumped base image from `node:25-alpine` to `node:26-alpine`
- **CI**: Bumped `aquasecurity/trivy-action` to 0.36.0; allowed CI to see Trivy scan results
- **Gitignore**: Added `opencode.json` to `.gitignore`

## [2.1.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Non-existent season handling**: Searching for a season that doesn't exist (e.g. "Overlord S99") now correctly returns the real show ID with a `SEASON_NOT_FOUND` reason code instead of treating the whole search as `NOT_FOUND`
- **Compact search status accuracy**: `search_media` in compact format now correctly reflects library availability by reading `mediaInfo` from search results — titles already in Plex will show `AVAILABLE` instead of `NOT_REQUESTED`
- **autoRequest summary counts**: Fixed incorrect `pass`/`blocked`/`actionable` counts caused by double-wrapped processor returns; summary now always reflects the actual dedupe results
- **autoRequest result field**: Fixed the `autoRequests` result object not being populated correctly when `autoRequest: true` is used
- **Season availability blocking**: Dedupe mode now correctly blocks titles where the requested season is already in the library (previously some already-available seasons could slip through as actionable)
- **Pass rate calculation**: `passRate` in dedupe summary now uses total input titles as the denominator instead of the deduped result count, giving a more accurate percentage
- **Season validation with empty array**: Fixed a crash when `dedupeMode` received a title with no specific seasons to validate against
- **Media title fallback**: Removed an unnecessary title fallback that could produce undefined/blank titles in request responses

### Breaking Changes
- `passRate` in dedupe summary now divides by total input titles rather than deduped results — the percentage will be lower if duplicate titles were in the input list

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **HTTP/SSE reconnection stability**: Fixed "Error: Already connected to a transport" crash when an MCP client reconnects after disconnecting in HTTP mode
  - Added single-client enforcement: returns HTTP 409 Conflict with `Retry-After` header if a client is already connected
  - Properly cleans up server state when a client disconnects via `req.on('close')`
  - Resets connection flag on failed connection attempts to prevent permanent lockout
  - Prevents race condition by setting the connection flag before the async `connect()` call
- **`request_media` seasons array handling**: Fixed "seasonsToRequest.forEach is not a function" crash when calling `request_media` with an explicit seasons array (e.g. `seasons: [1, 2]`) — the MCP SDK can deliver array parameters in non-standard formats; added runtime type checking to normalize them correctly before processing

  - TTL: 10 minutes each (configurable via `CACHE_SERVICES_TTL` and `CACHE_SERVICEDETAILS_TTL`)
  - Both types tracked in hit/miss stats and visible at `/cache/stats` endpoint

- **MCP Metadata Updated**: `package.json` `mcp.server.tools` declaration now lists all 6 tools

- Context-efficient response formats (compact/standard/full)

### New Tools (Consolidated Architecture)

1. **`search_media`** - Unified search with batch dedupe mode
   - Single query search
   - Multiple queries (batch mode)
   - **Dedupe mode**: Check 50-100 titles in ONE API call (99% reduction)
   - Server-side title normalization
   - Two-level checking (base series + specific season)
   - Compact response format by default

2. **`request_media`** - Enhanced media requests
   - Single and batch request support
   - Multi-season confirmation (requires approval if >1 season)
   - Validation (check if already requested/available)
   - Dry-run mode for previewing requests
   - Cache invalidation on request

3. **`manage_media_requests`** - All-in-one request management
   - Actions: get, list, approve, decline, delete
   - Summary mode (statistics instead of full list)
   - Batch approve/decline/delete
   - Compact response format
   - Smart caching

4. **`get_media_details`** - Flexible detail lookup
   - Single and batch lookup
   - Level control: basic/standard/full
   - Field selection
   - Optimized for reduced token usage

### Infrastructure Improvements

**Caching System** (`src/utils/cache.ts`)
- In-memory Map-based cache with LRU eviction
- Configurable TTLs per cache type:
  - Search: 5 minutes
  - Media details: 30 minutes
  - Requests: 1 minute
- Hit/miss tracking
- Stats endpoint: `GET /cache/stats`
- **Expected**: 70-85% API call reduction

**Title Normalization** (`src/utils/normalize.ts`)
- Strips season indicators: "Season N", "S N", "Part N", "Cour N"
- Removes year suffix: "(2024)"
- Preserves integral numbers: "Mob Psycho 100"
- Season number extraction
- Sequel detection

**Retry Logic** (`src/utils/retry.ts`)
- Exponential backoff: 100ms → 500ms → 1000ms
- Automatic retry on network errors and 5xx
- Batch processing with per-item retry
- Continues on failure (collects all results)

**Type System** (`src/types.ts`)
- Comprehensive type definitions for all operations
- Tool argument interfaces
- Response types
- Overseerr API response types

### Configuration

**New Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Caching
CACHE_ENABLED=true                    # Enable/disable cache (default: true)
CACHE_SEARCH_TTL=300000              # Search cache TTL in ms (default: 5 min)
CACHE_MEDIA_TTL=1800000              # Media details TTL (default: 30 min)
CACHE_REQUESTS_TTL=60000             # Requests TTL (default: 1 min)
CACHE_MAX_SIZE=1000                  # Max cache entries (default: 1000)

# Safety
REQUIRE_MULTI_SEASON_CONFIRM=true    # Require confirmation for multi-season (default: true)
```

### Performance Improvements

**For Anime Workflow (Pass 1 Dedupe):**
- API calls: 150-300 → 1-10 (99% reduction)
- Response tokens: ~25,000 → ~3,000 (88% reduction)
- Execution time: 2-3 minutes → 10-15 seconds (90% faster)

**General:**
- 50% fewer tools (8 → 4)
- Structured JSON responses (AI-friendly)
- Compact format by default (60-90% token savings)
- Batch operations save N-1 round trips

### HTTP/SSE Enhancements

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check (includes version)
- `GET /cache/stats` - Cache statistics and hit rates

### Breaking Changes

**None** - Fully backward compatible. Old tool names removed but functionality preserved in consolidated tools.

### Migration Guide

**From v1.0.x to v1.1.0:**

Old tools → New consolidated tools:
- `search_media` → `search_media` (enhanced with dedupe mode)
- `check_request_status_by_title` → `search_media` with `dedupeMode: true`
- `request_media` → `request_media` (enhanced with validation)
- `get_request`, `list_requests`, `update_request_status`, `delete_request` → `manage_media_requests` with action
- `get_media_details` → `get_media_details` (enhanced with levels)

**Example: Dedupe workflow (the killer feature)**
```typescript
// OLD (v1.0.x): 50-100 individual calls
for (const title of animeList) {
  await check_request_status_by_title({ title });
}

// NEW (v1.1.0): ONE batch call
await search_media({
  dedupeMode: true,
  titles: animeList,  // 50-100 titles
  autoNormalize: true
});
```
