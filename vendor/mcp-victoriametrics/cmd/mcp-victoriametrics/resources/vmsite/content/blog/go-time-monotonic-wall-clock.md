title: "Monotonic and Wall Clock Time in the Go time package"
summary: "Operating systems expose a wall clock that can leap or slew with NTP and a monotonic clock that never runs backward. In Go, only time.Now (might) carries both readings, while values from time.Parse, time.Date, etc., are wall-clock-only—so naïve equality checks or time.Since on those can mislead when the system clock shifts."

Modern operating systems usually keep track of two kinds of clocks: a wall clock and a monotonic clock.

The wall clock is the "real-world" clock that shows calendar dates and times, like UTC or your local time. This clock can be adjusted for synchronization (for example, using NTP) or manually changed by system administrators. It can also suddenly jump due to daylight saving time or leap seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a standard internet protocol that allows computers to exchange timestamps. Computers use NTP to synchronize their clocks to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Over the public internet, NTP usually achieves accuracy within a few milliseconds, and on fast local networks, it can be accurate to less than one millisecond.

Since wall clocks can jump forward or backward, slow down, or speed up, measuring time intervals directly using the wall clock can cause errors. For example, syncing time using NTP might slightly speed up or slow down the clock, or inserting a leap second can cause the same second to repeat, etc.

Before Go version 1.9, the time API only used wall-clock time. This created bugs when the clock was adjusted. A famous example was a leap-second bug that caused a [Cloudflare outage in 2016](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/).

To fix these issues, operating systems also use a second type of clock: a monotonic clock. This clock never goes backward. It only moves forward steadily and cannot be manually adjusted.

Because each clock behaves differently, they have separate purposes:

- Wall clocks are for "telling time" (giving timestamps that have meaning globally).
- Monotonic clocks are for reliably "measuring time intervals."

Go follows this same approach.

## Monotonic Clock

In Go, when you call `time.Now()`, the function returns a `time.Time` struct representing the current moment. This struct actually holds two different values: the wall clock time and an (optional) monotonic clock reading.

The monotonic part is stored internally in the `ext` field of the `time.Time` struct. You can't access this directly through Go's public API — it's only used behind the scenes.

Since the monotonic reading is tied specifically to your current process and system uptime, it has no real meaning outside your running program. That's why, when you serialize a `time.Time`, the monotonic component isn't included. 

But you may notice during debugging that printing a `time.Time` struct gives you an extra suffix like `m=+0.000123456`:

```go {hl_lines=[3]}
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	fmt.Println(now) // 2024-11-10 23:00:00 +0000 UTC m=+0.001219709
}
```

That `m=` value shows the monotonic clock offset (in seconds) at the exact moment your `time.Time` was captured. In the example above, this means `0.001219709` seconds passed since the program started running.

When your Go program starts, it notes the current operating system's monotonic clock value. Each time you call `time.Now()`, Go calculates how much time has passed since your program began. This is what the hidden monotonic field shows: elapsed nanoseconds since your process started, not since your machine booted.

## Common Mistakes

The monotonic clock in `time.Time` is optional. A `time.Time` value only includes a monotonic reading when it is created directly by the runtime. 

This happens in exactly one place: when you call `time.Now()`. Other ways to construct a `time.Time` value, such as `time.Date`, `time.Unix`, `time.Parse`, or any unmarshaling function, never set the monotonic flag. 

These only set the wall-clock time:

```go {hl_lines=["11-13"]}
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	fmt.Println(now)
	fmt.Println(now.UTC())
	fmt.Println(now.Truncate(0))
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2025, 7, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
}

// Output:
// 2025-07-13 12:14:36.707899 +0000 UTC m=+0.000080168
// 2025-07-13 12:14:36.707899 +0000 UTC
// 2025-07-13 12:14:36.707899 +0000 UTC
// 2025-07-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
```

You can see that the last three timers do not have the `m=` prefix.

### Comparing Two time.Time Values

A common mistake is comparing `time.Time` values using the equality operator:

```go
func main() {
	now := time.Now()
	nowUTC := now.UTC()
	nowTruncated := now.Truncate(0)

	fmt.Println(now == nowUTC) // false
	fmt.Println(now == nowTruncated) // false
	fmt.Println(nowUTC == nowTruncated) // false
}
```

There are two problems with this. First, when you call `now.UTC()` or `now.Truncate(0)`, these methods deliberately remove the monotonic part from the original value. That's why `now != nowTruncated`.

Second, and more confusing, even though both `now.UTC()` and `now.Truncate(0)` strip the monotonic reading, comparing them with `==` still returns `false`. This is because the `time.Time` struct contains a pointer to represent the location (`*time.Location`). The `UTC()` method not only removes the monotonic part but also sets the location pointer to nil. The `Truncate(0)` call does not change the location pointer.

To compare two `time.Time` values correctly, use the `Equal` method instead:

```go
fmt.Println(now.Equal(nowUTC)) // true
fmt.Println(now.Equal(nowTruncated)) // true
fmt.Println(nowUTC.Equal(nowTruncated)) // true
```

Everything now works as you would expect. The `Equal` method has two paths for checking:

- If both `time.Time` values have a monotonic reading, Go compares their monotonic clocks.
- If they do not, Go compares the wall-clock values, including the seconds and the nanoseconds.

```go
func (t Time) Equal(u Time) bool {
	// monotonic clock check
	if t.wall&u.wall&hasMonotonic != 0 {
		return t.ext == u.ext
	}

	// wall clock check
	return t.sec() == u.sec() && t.nsec() == u.nsec()
}
```

### Use Wall Clock To Measure Time

As we discussed, functions like `time.Date`, `time.Unix`, and `time.Parse` create `time.Time` values with only the wall-clock fields. These constructors never attach a monotonic reading, because they do not query the runtime's monotonic counter.

Only `time.Now` (and a few helpers that call it internally) fetch the monotonic counter and store it inside the value. When you use operations that do not change the instant itself (such as `Add`, `AddDate`, `Sub`, `Round`, `Truncate`, or simple arithmetic with `Duration`), Go will carry the monotonic part forward if it was there to begin with.

For example, `time.Since` is just a shortcut for `time.Now().Sub(t)`. It will use the monotonic clock if your `time.Time` value contains it:

```go
package time

func Since(t Time) Duration {
	if t.wall&hasMonotonic != 0 {
		return subMono(runtimeNano()-startNano, t.ext)
	}
	return Now().Sub(t)
}
```

If you use `time.Since` with a `time.Time` value that does not have the monotonic clock, you can run into problems:

```go
// parse the time (wall clock only, no monotonic)
lastModified, _ := time.Parse(http.TimeFormat, rawHeader)

// lastModified lacks monotonic data, so Since falls back to wall clock math
ago := time.Since(lastModified)
```

The problem is, the system's wall clock might not be accurate and can be adjusted. This means `ago` might not represent the real duration between `lastModified` and now.

### Schedule Based on Monotonic Time

On the other hand, if your application cares about "what time is it right now?" or "what is the next wall-clock time to process?", you need to use wall clock comparisons and be careful if the time can move backward.

For example, on some systems, when the machine goes to sleep or suspends, the monotonic clock usually pauses. When the system resumes, the monotonic clock continues from where it left off. This does not count the time spent sleeping.

Go’s design helps protect you from many timing bugs, especially those caused by wall clock jumps, by defaulting to monotonic time for measuring intervals and scheduling timers (like `time.NewTicker`, `time.Sleep`, and others). This is almost always the right behavior — unless you really need to schedule things based on the wall clock, as people see it, regardless of any time jumps. This comes up in cron jobs, log rotation, alert checks, and other jobs that must follow the calendar clock.

## How time.Time Looks Like

Before Go 1.9, the `time.Time` struct was simple:

```go
type Time struct {
	sec int64
	nsec int32

	loc *Location
}
```

Here, `sec` is a signed 64-bit count of seconds from the Go "internal" epoch (Jan 1 0001 00:00:00 UTC). `nsec` is a signed 32-bit count in the range [0, 1e9). Together they give 1‑ns resolution across a range of billions of years.

Go 1.9 introduced monotonic time to make measuring elapsed time safe against clock changes. From this version on, when you call `time.Now()`, the returned `time.Time` value can carry both a wall-clock timestamp and, optionally, a monotonic timestamp.

No matter the Go version, `time.Time` has always used 24 bytes of memory (two 64-bit words plus a pointer). When adding monotonic time in Go 1.9, the Go team kept this size the same:

```go
type Time struct {
	wall uint64
	ext  int64

	loc *Location
}
```

Just from looking at this struct, you cannot see how both timestamps are stored. The answer comes from how Go evolved its time layout.

To fit both numbers in 128 bits, Go changed the layout. When there is **no** monotonic timestamp, `ext` can use all its 64 bits to store wall-clock seconds. This gives an enormous range—about ±292 billion years.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Go time.Time fields for wall-clock only</figcaption>

When a monotonic timestamp is stored, `ext` is used for the monotonic seconds instead. In this case, wall seconds move into the `wall` word.

![Go time.Time with monotonic timestamp included](/blog/go-time-monotonic-wall-clock/go-monotonic-wall-clock.webp)
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Go time.Time with monotonic timestamp included</figcaption>

To do this, Go uses the 33 bits in `wall` that were not needed before to represent wall-clock seconds. This covers the years 1885 to 2157, which is enough for practical dates. The 30 low bits of `wall` still store nanoseconds as before.

But what happens if a `time.Time` carries a monotonic clock, but its wall-clock date falls outside the 1885–2157 range?

You can see this behavior in the `time.Add()` method, which normally does not strip the monotonic clock. It adds the duration to both the wall and monotonic clocks:

```go {hl_lines=7}
func (t Time) Add(d Duration) Time {
	...
	if t.wall&hasMonotonic != 0 {
		te := t.ext + int64(d)
		if d < 0 && te > t.ext || d > 0 && te < t.ext {
			// Monotonic clock reading now out of range; degrade to wall-only.
			t.stripMono()
		} else {
			t.ext = te
		}
	}
	return t
}
```

However, when the wall clock falls outside the valid range, Go silently strips the monotonic data. All this juggling is hidden from users of `time.Time`. It just works, but understanding this trick can help you know what is happening under the hood.

Most of the time, this works fine. But when our application scales across many different machines and scenarios, we need to consider edge cases and understand how everything works.
