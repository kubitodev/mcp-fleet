## Receiving Requests From vmselect  

By default, **vmstorage** listens for connections from `vmselect` on a dedicated TCP port, `8401` (configured with `-vmselectAddr`).  

Whenever `vmselect` connects, the two start a handshake process to negotiate details like the compression algorithm. Unless you've explicitly disabled it (`-rpc.disableCompression=false`), vmstorage will compress the data it sends back to `vmselect` to save bandwidth.  

Requests coming from `vmselect` follow this general structure: 

```go
<rpcName> <traceEnable?> <timeout> <request>
```

Now, vmselect doesn't just send query requests—it asks vmstorage a variety of things, each tied to a specific rpcName. Here are a few examples:

- `search_v7` – This is the one we're focusing on today. It handles the main search query for time series data.
- `deleteSeries_v5` – Used to delete time series data that matches specific criteria. This removes data points from storage.
- `seriesCount_v4` – Returns a single number representing the total number of series in storage.
- `searchMetricNames_v3` – Searches for metric names based on specific criteria.

Let's stick to the star of the show: the `search_v7` request format:

```go
["search_v7"][traceEnable?][timeout][search-request]
```

One cool thing about this is the tracing feature (`-traceEnable`), which happens to be one of my favorites. Tracing lets you locate bottlenecks during query processing — think of it as the equivalent of `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL. It shows you the exact steps a query goes through and how much time each one takes.

If you're curious, there's an excellent article that dives into this feature: [How to reduce expenses on monitoring - Roman Khavronenko](/blog/reducing-costs-p2/).

There's also a timeout on requests from `vmselect`, which is set to 30 seconds by default. We'll talk more about this timeout in the vminsert article, so let's leave it for now.  

> [!TIP] Tip: Useful metrics
> - Current active connections from vmselect: `vm_vmselect_conns`  
> - How many connection errors with vmselect nodes: `vm_vmselect_conn_errors_total`  
> - How many requests are search queries: `vm_vmselect_rpc_requests_total{action="search"}`  

Just like it does with vminsert, vmstorage applies a concurrency limit to RPC requests from vmselect. This is controlled by `-search.maxConcurrentRequests`, which, by default, allows up to 2x your CPU cores worth of concurrent RPC requests. If the number of requests exceeds that, they'll wait in a queue for up to 10 seconds (`-search.maxQueueDuration`) before being rejected.  

If you're dealing with a slow network or running into network bottlenecks, increasing these limits might help as it brings the workload to the CPU. Otherwise, it's better to leave them as they are.

## Find Metric IDs (and TSIDs) of Timeseries  

Let's say you want to search for metrics in the timeseries `http_request_total{status!="500"}` across two days: 2024-01-01 and 2024-01-02.  

IndexDB takes the filter tags from vmselect, `__name__=http_request_total` and `status=500`. The main goal at this stage is to find the metric IDs for all timeseries that match the filter tags. These could be:  

- `41: http_request_total{url="/metrics",status="500",method="GET"}`  
- `124: http_request_total{url="/insert",status="500",method="POST"}`  
- `495: http_request_total{url="/query",status="500",method="GET"}`  
- ...  

To speed things up, IndexDB has an in-memory cache that stores the metric IDs for tag filters. For example, it might check if the key `2024-01-01 2024-01-02 http_request_total status=500` is already in the cache. This tag-filter cache uses 3% of vmstorage's total memory (`-storage.cacheSizeIndexDBTagFilters`).  

If there's a cache miss, vmstorage searches the current IndexDB. It chooses between two indexes:  
- The **per-day index** `tag to metric IDs`: if your query covers a range of 40 days or less.  
- The **global index** `tag to metric IDs`: for longer ranges.  

Let's focus on the per-day index since it also explains how the global index works.  

For the example query, vmstorage identifies the days it needs to search: 2024-01-01 and 2024-01-02. It then searches those days in parallel using the prefixes `6 2024-01-01 http_request_total` and `6 2024-01-02 status=500` (or composite index `6 2024-01-01 http_request_total,status=500`, but let's keep it simple).  

At this point, it scans the in-memory part, small parts, big parts in IndexDB to find the metric IDs for the relevant tags. 

Fortunately, vmstorage doesn't search every part. It can skip parts that aren't relevant just by looking at the **last item** in each part:

![Parts filtered using last item boundaries](/blog/vmstorage-how-it-handles-query-requests/part-boundary-check.webp)  
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Parts filtered using last item boundaries</figcaption>  

This works because each part is sorted alphabetically. By comparing the query's boundaries to the last item in a part, vmstorage can quickly decide whether that part needs to be searched or can be safely ignored.  

Now, vmstorage uses the pre-loaded `metaindex.bin` file to figure out the first block it needs to read, then starts loading rows from `index.bin` into memory, one by one. 

If you remember, each row in `index.bin` is an array of block headers. To make things faster, vmstorage keeps a small cache for these index rows, so it doesn't have to constantly read them from disk. By default, this cache takes up 10% of vmstorage's total memory (`-storage.cacheSizeIndexDBIndexBlocks`).

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">IndexDB index.bin file</figcaption>

Once vmstorage has the block headers, it knows how to load the actual blocks from `items.bin` and `lens.bin`. To avoid loading from disk, there's also a small cache here for frequently accessed blocks, which uses 25% of the total memory by default (`-storage.cacheSizeIndexDBDataBlocks`). 

After loading the target block into memory, it's all about comparisons. 

For instance, vmstorage only need to compare the prefix `6 2024-01-01 http_request_total` against every row of the block (rows in the block are sorted by prefix so we can stop once we find a row that doesn't match).

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Matching prefix to locate metric IDs</figcaption>  

Once all the metric IDs for each tag are found, things get a bit easier. The next step is to **intersect** those IDs to find which ones match all the tags in the query:

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Intersecting metric IDs to match tags</figcaption>  

But what happens if the tag is `status!=500` instead of `status=500`? 

In that case, instead of intersecting, vmstorage **subtracts** the set of metric IDs for `status=500` from the set of metric IDs for `http_request_total`.  

After identifying the metric IDs that meet all the criteria, IndexDB uses these IDs to look up the corresponding `TSIDs` in the `metric ID to TSID` global index. This mapping also has a cache, which takes up 6.25% of vmstorage's total memory (not configurable) and is persistent on disk (`/<-storageDataPath>/cache/metricID_tsid`).

## Find Values & Timestamps of Timeseries  

All timeseries data stored in a block shares the same `TSID`, which is the unique identifier found in the block header. The goal at this stage is to locate all relevant blocks and send them over to vmselect.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Blocks store timeseries data with unique TSIDs</figcaption>  

The process of locating blocks in the main storage is similar to how it's done in IndexDB, so we can skip rehashing those steps here.  

Once a block with a matching metric ID is found, vmstorage needs to retrieve the corresponding metric name. This is done by querying IndexDB's `metric ID to metric name` global index. The process starts by checking a cache to avoid unnecessary lookups. This cache is persistent on disk (`/<-storageDataPath>/cache/metricID_metricName`) and uses 10% of total memory. If the metric name isn't in the cache, vmstorage searches the current IndexDB and, if needed, checks previous IndexDBs as well.  

Finally, vmstorage sends the blocks, along with the metric names, to vmselect for further processing.

Now that all the concepts are clear, the summary of this article is quite straightforward:
